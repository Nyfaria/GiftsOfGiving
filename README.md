**Gifts of Giving** is a simple mod made for this year's Christmas, but can still be used year-round!

This mod adds new gift box blocks, one for each dye color. Not only are these blocks cute and great for decoration, but they are functional too! Simply rename the gift box in an anvil to the name of the person you want to give the gift to. The name will be displayed above the present when you place it down. After renaming the gift, place it down, open it (like a chest), and place your gifts inside.

In order to ensure your goodies are not stolen by anybody you don't want to give gifts to, only the person who the present is named after (and the gifter) can open it.

Also, destroying the present will keep the gifts inside of it, like a shulker. We see you, thieves.Â So make sure you're being good!

To craft a gift, simply put paper around a chest. You can then combine it with any dye in the crafting slots to dye it any color you want.
